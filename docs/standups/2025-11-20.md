# Day 32 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** November 20, 2025

**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

---

## What We Did Today

The team focused on code integration, hardware communication troubleshooting, and documentation improvements. Hugo prepared the code structure for motor and speed sensor integration and helped Miguel with STM32-to-Expansion Board communication. Gaspar enhanced the AGL documentation with detailed guides for Qt Creator setup and build configuration. Melanie continued advancing the TSF framework, while Miguel made progress on hardware ID implementation for the STM32 MCU.

## Team Progress

### Bernardo - Hardware Integration & Testing
- 🔄 Preparing sprint review presentation for Friday
- 🔄 Working with Hugo and Miguel to implement his code on Hugo's Qt

### Gaspar - OS & Development Environment
- ✅ Created detailed guide for setting up Qt Creator for AGL cross-compilation
- ✅ Expanded AGL build guide with more information on image features and layer configuration

### Hugo - Hardware & Fabrication
- ✅ Prepared code structure to receive motor and speed sensor code from Miguel and Bernardo
- ✅ Helped Miguel troubleshoot communication from STM32 to Expansion Board and subsequent modules
- 🔄 Working on implementing motor/sensor code with his new Qt

### Melanie - GUI & Team Coordination
- ✅ Adapt classical V-model (URD/SRD/SWD/LLTC structure) to TSF framework
- 🔄 Investigation on possible URD/SRD/SWD/LLTC for the project

### Miguel - GitHub Project & Agile/Scrum
