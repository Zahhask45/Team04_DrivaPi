# Day [16] - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** Wednesday, October 29, 2025
**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

## What We Did Today

Today, Gaspar advanced on the AGL implementation by resolving SDK issues and enabling cross-compiling for C, C++, and Rust, while exploring GitHub workflow automation. Miguel completed his GenAI spike and presented options to the team, reinforcing the prior decision on Copilot. Bernardo wrapped up his communication methods research and shared it with facilitators, Hugo troubleshooted ThreadX execution, and Melanie updated TSF templates and documentation. Additionally, we received and tested our customized piece for detecting wheel speed, confirming it has appropriate dimensions and the sensor detects it successfully.

## Team Progress

### Bernardo - Hardware Integration & Testing
- ✅ Concluded the spike on comparing CAN, CAN_FD, and different communication processes with uProtocol implementation.
- ✅ Presented the communication study to facilitators during the stand-up meeting for feedback on the best approach.

### Gaspar - OS & Development Environment
- ✅ Resolved SDK difficulties for installing gcc, cc, and c++ tools in AGL.
- ✅ Achieved cross-compiling for C, C++, and Rust.
- 🔄 Working on QT dependencies to enable cross-compiling for QT.
- 🔄 Explored automation of GitHub workflows, including pull request templates.

### Hugo - Hardware & Fabrication
- 🔄 Continued exploring ThreadX and STM32 microcontroller programming, with code working directly on the microcontroller but facing issues in ThreadX execution.
- ✅ Received training from Miguel on creating sub-issues with the correct template.
- ✅ Received and tested the customized wheel speed detection piece; it fits dimensions and the sensor detects it.

### Melanie - GUI & Team Coordination
- 🔄 Updated requirements templates based on spike evidence.
- ✅ Modified .gitignore and the TSF validation workflow to validate artifacts.
- ✅ Updated existing documentation.
- 🔄 Created a document on artifacts conventions, currently in review.

### Miguel - GitHub Project & Agile/Scrum
- ✅ Finished the GenAI spike decision on GenAi Agent.
- ✅ Held a team meeting to present GenAI options: Copilot Pro (integrated in VSCode, newer models, free for 42 students) and TabNine Pro (anticipates code, customizable, trainable, but with associated cost).

## Challenges

**Problem:** Difficulties executing code in ThreadX (works directly on microcontroller).
- **Who:** Hugo
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Continue studying ThreadX documentation and seek additional team support if needed.

**Problem:** SDK issues for installing gcc, cc, and c++ tools in AGL.
- **Who:** Gaspar
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Resolved through targeted troubleshooting and configuration adjustments.

## Decisions

**GenAI Tool Selection:**
- Option A: TabNine Pro – Better anticipation, customizable, and trainable, but with associated costs.
- Option B: Copilot Pro – Integrated in VSCode, uses newer models, and available for free as 42 students.
- **Decision:** Copilot Pro (confirmed after team presentation).

## Standards & Research

- Bernardo's research on communication methods: Ethernet preferred for uProtocol due to stability and high data flow handling; CAN and CAN_FD comparisons completed, with challenges noted for uProtocol on CAN.
