# Day 48 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** Tuesday, December 16, 2025

**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

## What We Did Today

Testing infrastructure development advanced with unit test implementation using Unity and CMock, coverage reporting setup, and static analysis workflow using CodeQL. CAN bidirectional communication was proved, OS updates included preempt-RT patches, and latency testing implementation began on Linux.

## Team Progress

### Bernardo - Hardware Integration & Testing
- 🔄 Started unit tests for velocity functionality
- 🔄 Divided unit tests into classifications

### Gaspar - OS & Development Environment
- ✅ Updated OS to include preempt-RT patches
- 🔄 Fixing AGL on host machine
- ✅ Configured Dependabot to verify and update dependencies on weekly basis

### Hugo - Hardware & Fabrication
