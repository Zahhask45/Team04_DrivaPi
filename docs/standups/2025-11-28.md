# Day 38 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** Thursday, November 28, 2025

**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

## What We Did Today

The team focused on system infrastructure, deployment automation, and real-time operating system migration. Gaspar resolved AGL dependency issues and successfully migrated the boot process from SSD to microSD card. Bernardo fixed speed sensor ticks calculations and readings. Melanie conducted technical investigations on Kuska, Uprotocol, and VSS, concluding that Kuska is recommended while Uprotocol is not viable for STM32. Hugo completed the GitHub Actions spike with comprehensive documentation on deployment steps. Miguel worked on transitioning motor and servo test code to ThreadX RTOS.

## Challenges

**Problem:** Uprotocol Compatibility with STM32
- **Who:** Melanie
- **Impact:** High
- **Solution:** Determined that Uprotocol cannot be made "light" enough for STM32 compatibility. Decision: Not viable for current hardware architecture.

**Problem:** ThreadX RTOS Migration
- **Who:** Miguel
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Actively transitioning motor and servo test code from bare-metal to ThreadX real-time operating system

## Decisions

**Communication Protocol Selection:**
- **Investigation:** Uprotocol vs Kuska for vehicle communication
- **Uprotocol Conclusion:** Not compatible with STM32 microcontroller; cannot create lightweight version
- **Kuska Conclusion:** Recommended - minimal expected performance losses
- **Decision:** Proceed with Kuska implementation for vehicle communication protocol

**Boot Configuration:**
- **Decision:** Migrate AGL boot from SSD to microSD card
- **Outcome:** Successfully completed, improving system portability
- **Impact:** Simplifies deployment and hardware configuration

**Deployment Strategy:**
- **Investigation:** GitHub Actions capabilities for CI/CD
- **Outcome:** Hugo documented comprehensive deployment steps
- **Decision:** Clear path forward for automated deployment using GitHub Actions

---

## Standards & Research

**Vehicle Communication Protocols:**
- **Kuska:** Recommended for implementation - lightweight with minimal overhead
- **Uprotocol:** Not viable for STM32 - too heavy for microcontroller constraints
- **VSS (Vehicle Signal Specification):** Investigation completed for standardized signal definitions

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
- GitHub Actions spike completed with full documentation
- Deployment workflow steps clearly defined
- Ready for implementation phase

**RTOS Migration:**
- Transitioning to ThreadX for improved real-time performance
- Motor and servo control being migrated from bare-metal implementation
