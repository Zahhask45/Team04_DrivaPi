## What We Did Today

Today, we successfully read data from the speed sensor using the STM32 microcontroller with ThreadX. We also set up two LEDs to act as indicators, displaying the information received from the sensor. In parallel, we continued building the AGL system, researching TSF, and studying different communication methods that may be used in the future, such as CAN, Ethernet, and others. Additionally, we continued our research on generative AI tools for integration into the project.

## Team Progress

### Bernardo - Continue research on communication methods 
- 🔄 Bernardo continued studying the different communication methods between system components.
- 🔄 Ethernet: Research completed — identified as providing higher speed but lower security.
- 🔄 CAN: Still searching.
- 🔄 UProtocol: Will be challenge to implement with CAN, ethernet proves to be the best way (stable and more capable of handle high flows of data). 

### Gaspar - OS & Development Environment
- 🔄 AGL (Automotive Grade Linux): Only the root account is currently available.
- 🔄 No graphical interface yet.
- 🔄 Implement screen rotation functionality.
- 🔄 Integrate Qt into the AGL build.
- 🔄 Some dependencies (for example GCC compiler) still need to be installed or resolved.

### Hugo - Research and implementation on STM32:
- ✅ Integrate the ThreadX real-time operating system (RTOS) into the STM32 environment.
- 🔄 Conduct research and begin implementation of STM32 microcontroller programming.

### Melanie - TSF && data protocols 
- ✅ Mel will continued and finished the spike on the artifacts.
- 🔄 Preparing for the next lab session.
- 🔄 Update and improve the templates.
- 🔄 Conduct research on data transfer like Bernardo did. 

### Miguel - GitHub Project & Agile/Scrum
- 🔄 Miguel organized the rest of the issues for the current sprint.
- 🔄 Researched which generative AI tool to use (decision: GitHub Copilot).
- ✅ Helped teammates update their tasks and sub-issues in the GitHub project.
