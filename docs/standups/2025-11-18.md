# Day 30 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** November 18, 2025

**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

## What We Did Today

The team made significant progress across multiple fronts. Hugo completed the ThreadX architecture implementation with queues, flags, mutexes, and threads, integrating CAN communication for transmit and receive operations. Bernardo successfully resolved the speed sensor measurement issue, achieving correct velocity readings. Miguel implemented and tested DC motor and servo motor code on STM32 for future ThreadX integration. Gaspar made progress on Raspberry Pi SSD boot issues and began documenting the Qt app cross-compilation process. Melanie submitted the CI/CD workflow for review and started defining a new approach for the TSF framework.

## Team Progress

### Bernardo - Hardware Integration & Testing
- ✅ Fixed STM32 speed sensor calculation issues
- ✅ Identified issue was not hardware-related
- ✅ Changed approach: counting pulses instead of using interrupts
- ✅ Successfully obtained correct speed measurement values by end of day
