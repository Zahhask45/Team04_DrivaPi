## What We Did Today

Today we achieved successful CAN communication between Raspberry Pi and STM32 after extensive debugging and oscilloscope analysis. The team focused on hardware validation, SDK development for AGL cross-compilation, and Sprint 3 preparation. Melanie worked on presentation preparation and TSF validation methodology.

## Hardware

**CAN Communication Breakthrough:**

Successfully established CAN communication between Raspberry Pi and STM32 after debugging. Key findings from oscilloscope analysis of CAN H and CAN L signals led to identifying the correct CAN port selection and bit rate synchronization between devices. Ground sharing between Raspberry Pi and STM32 was implemented through soldered cable connections.

## Software

**Progress:**
- ✅ Gen AI review completed
- 🔄 SDK extended version for AGL cross-compilation in progress
- 🔄 Sprint 3 preparation underway

## Challenges

**Problem:** CAN Communication Failure
- **Who:** Hugo, Bernardo
- **Impact:** High
- **Solution:** Oscilloscope analysis revealed issues with CAN port selection and bit rate mismatch. Fixed by changing CAN port and recalculating bit rates to ensure Raspberry Pi and STM32 match.

**Problem:** TSF Validation
- **Who:** Melanie
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Currently performing manual validation. Researching TSF after colleague's feedback. Team considering automation implementation for future validation processes.

**Problem:** SDK Development Errors
- **Who:** Gaspar
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Errors discovered in SDK extended version. Working on building SDK for cross-compilation and preparing AGL installation on formatted SSD.

## Decisions

**TSF Validation Approach:**
- Option A: Continue with manual validation
- Option B: Implement automation for validation
- **Decision:** Currently performing manual validation while researching automation feasibility

---

## Standards & Research

**TSF (Trustable Software Framework):** Conducting research to clarify approach and determine best practices for the team.
