## What We Did Today

Today the entire team completed Hands-on Lab 2 for TSF (Trustable Software Framework), learning critical skills for ISO 26262 compliance including HARA documentation, ASIL justification, evidence linking, and SME scoring methodology.

## Team Progress

### Entire Team - TSF Hands-on Lab 2

**All team members learned:**
- ✅ HARA (Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment) creation
- ✅ ASIL calculation (Severity × Exposure × Controllability)
- ✅ ASIL justification writing
- ✅ Evidence artifact linking (code, tests, analysis, design, compliance docs)
- ✅ SME scoring methodology (score at LLTC level, propagates upward)
- ✅ Requirement chain assessment (URD→SRD→SWD→LLTC)

### Melanie - Lab Facilitation
- ✅ Facilitated Hands-on Lab 2
- ✅ Finalized Lab 2 documentation

## Standards & Research

**TSF Hands-on Lab 2:**

**Key Skills Learned:**

1. **HARA Documentation:**
   - Identify hazards and assess Severity, Exposure, Controllability
   - Calculate ASIL using ISO 26262 table
   - Define safety goals

2. **ASIL Justification:**
   - Link to HARA and safety goals
   - Create risk assessment tables
   - Define verification requirements

3. **Evidence Linking:**
   - Code artifacts (implementation, headers)
   - Test artifacts (results, coverage)
   - Verification artifacts (static analysis)
   - Design artifacts (architecture, interfaces)
   - Compliance artifacts (HARA, ASIL docs)

4. **SME Scoring (Critical):**
   - **Score at LLTC level**
   - Review entire chain before scoring
   - Scores propagate **upward** to parents
   - Score reflects confidence in entire requirement chain
