# Day [28] - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** November 14, 2025
**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

---

## What We Did Today

The team participated in a ThreadX training session in the morning, led by Hugo. In the afternoon, Hugo analyzed potential architectural restructuring for the car project. Multiple team members worked on resolving build issues, OS configuration, requirements documentation, and testing infrastructure.

---

## Team Progress

### Bernardo - Hardware Integration & Testing
- ✅ Fixed IDE issues encountered when running the build for the STM32

### Gaspar - OS & Development Environment
- 🔄 Working on the Yocto project (virtual kernel runs on SSD, but AGL cannot access the SSD - debugging in progress)

### Hugo - Hardware & Fabrication
- ✅ Conducted ThreadX training session for the team (morning)
- ✅ Analyzed the possibility of restructuring the car's architecture (afternoon)

### Melanie - GUI & Team Coordination
- ✅ Created a diagram of possible requirements for project implementation
- ✅ Researched the proposed architecture change
- ✅ Created GitHub Actions to produce results from the TSF tests

### Miguel - GitHub Project & Agile/Scrum
- 🔄 Installing the STM32 IDE to test the main language change from Rust to C

---

## Hardware

**Progress:**
- STM32 build environment issues resolved
- STM32 IDE setup in progress for language migration testing

---

## Software

**Progress:**
- ✅ ThreadX training completed
- ✅ GitHub Actions for TSF tests created
- 🔄 Yocto/AGL SSD access debugging
- 🔄 STM32 IDE installation and C language testing

---

## Challenges

**Problem:** AGL SSD Access Issue
- **Who:** Gaspar
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Debugging Yocto configuration to enable AGL access to SSD

---

## Decisions

**Architecture Restructuring:**
- Initial analysis completed by Hugo
- Requirements diagram and research conducted by Mel
- **Decision:** Under evaluation

**Language Migration (Rust to C):**
- **Decision:** Testing phase initiated with STM32 IDE setup

---

## Standards & Research

- ThreadX RTOS training conducted
- Architecture restructuring possibilities analyzed
