## What We Did Today

The team achieved major integration milestones with ThreadX app testing combining servo, DC motors, and speed sensor code working successfully. Key progress includes Rust CAN messaging on Raspberry Pi 5, Sprint Retrospective preparation, cooling solutions for hardware, CAN latency measurements, and continued KUKSA/VSS/AGL research spikes.

## Challenges

**Problem:** STM32 Dongle Bluetooth Implementation
- **Who:** Hugo
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Research spike completed - determined that STM32 dongle cannot be implemented on Bluetooth. Documented findings for future reference.

**Problem:** AGL Learning Curve for KUKSA Testing
- **Who:** Melanie
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Learning AGL with Gaspar's help, conducting research spikes and tests. KUKSA & VSS spikes moved to next sprint for further research.

---

## Decisions

**KUKSA & VSS Research:**
- **Decision:** Move KUKSA & VSS spikes to next sprint
- **Rationale:** Additional research needed, AGL learning curve requires more time
- **Next steps:** Continue research and testing with Gaspar's support

**STM32 Dongle Communication:**
- **Decision:** STM32 dongle will not use Bluetooth implementation
- **Rationale:** Research spike concluded Bluetooth is not viable for this use case
- **Next steps:** Consider alternative communication methods

---

## Standards & Research

**KUKSA & VSS Spike**
- Advanced progress on KUKSA and VSS research
- Latency comparison between CAN and KUKSA underway
- Integration with AGL environment being tested

**CAN Latency Measurement**
- Raw CAN latency measurement code completed
- Ready for comparative analysis with other protocols

**Code Quality Analysis**
- Studying .CYCLO output files for potential optimization
- Evaluating whether these files can be removed from the build process
