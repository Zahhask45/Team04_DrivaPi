# Day 31 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** November 19, 2025

**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

---

## What We Did Today

The team focused on code reviews, documentation, and framework redesign. Melanie made significant progress defining TSF tenets and trustable assertions, transitioning to a new model using expectations, assertions, and evidence instead of the classical V-model layers. Gaspar and Bernardo conducted multiple pull request reviews. Miguel continued debugging pin addressing for data transmission. Bernardo prepared the sprint retrospective presentation and reviewed Hugo's battery consumption study.

## Team Progress

### Bernardo - Hardware Integration & Testing
- ✅ Conducted multiple pull request reviews
- ✅ Studied Hugo's power consumption analysis (one mega battery vs two batteries)
- ✅ Presented consumption study findings in standup meeting
- 🔄 Preparing sprint retrospective presentation for Friday

### Gaspar - OS & Development Environment
- ✅ Conducted multiple pull request reviews
- ✅ Documented Qt cross-compilation process
- 🔄 Still needs to document Qt Creator setup and configuration

### Melanie - GUI & Team Coordination
- ✅ Defined TSF tenets and trustable assertions
- ✅ Started transition to new TSF model
- ✅ Designing framework using expectations, assertions, and evidence
- ✅ Moving away from classical V-model (URD/SRD/SWD/LLTC structure)

### Miguel - GitHub Project & Agile/Scrum
- ✅ Made progress on STM32 code implementation
- ✅ Code logic is correct
- 🔄 Still discovering correct pin address for data transmission

---

## Hardware

**Battery Configuration Study:**
- Study presented and discussed in standup meeting

**STM32 Pin Addressing:**
- Miguel's code operational but requires pin address verification for data transmission

---

## Software

**Progress:**
- ✅ Qt cross-compilation documentation completed (Gaspar)
- ✅ C code to be integrated in ThreadX working (Miguel)
- ✅ TSF framework redesign initiated (Melanie)
- 🔄 Pin addressing investigation ongoing (Miguel)

## Challenges

**Problem:** STM32 Pin Address Discovery
- **Who:** Miguel
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Code is functional; investigating correct pin address for data transmission to ensure proper communication

---

## Decisions

**TSF Framework Transition:**
- **Decision:** Moving from classical V-model (URD/SRD/SWD/LLTC) to new TSF model
- **New Approach:** Framework based on expectations, assertions, and evidence
- **Rationale:** Simplify traceability and align with trustable assertion methodology
- **Status:** Tenets defined, framework design in progress

---

## Standards & Research

**TSF Framework Redesign:**
- Defining TSF tenets (core principles)
- Establishing trustable assertions methodology
- New model structure:
  - **Expectations:** What the system should do
  - **Assertions:** Claims about system behavior
  - **Evidence:** Proof that assertions are true
- Moving away from rigid V-model layers (URD/SRD/SWD/LLTC)
- Goal: More flexible and assertion-based traceability framework

**Documentation:**
- Qt cross-compilation process documented for team reference
- Sprint retrospective preparation
