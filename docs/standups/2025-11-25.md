# Day 35 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** Monday, November 25, 2025

**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

---

## What We Did Today

The team focused on hardware integration and CI/CD improvements. Bernardo presented Fibonacci estimation techniques to SEAME teams and integrated sensors with ThreadX code. Miguel worked on DC motor integration with ThreadX. Melanie updated Qt code to receive CAN data through serial bus libraries. Hugo implemented cross-compilation through GitHub Actions and began QEMU emulator setup for automated testing.

## Challenges

**Problem:** AGL SSD Boot Configuration
- **Who:** Gaspar
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Modified boot configuration file but system continues booting from micro SD; further investigation needed

**Problem:** DC Motors Simultaneous Operation
- **Who:** Miguel
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Both motors work individually but not together; investigating ThreadX integration and timing issues

**Problem:** Qt Dependencies and Plugins
- **Who:** Melanie
- **Impact:** Low (Resolved)
- **Solution:** Successfully resolved dependency and plugin issues; CAN data reception now functional

---

## Decisions

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
- **Decision:** Implemented GitHub Actions for cross-compilation and automated build testing
- Next step: Add QEMU emulator for automated runtime testing

**CAN Communication:**
- **Decision:** Use Qt serial bus libraries for CAN data reception in GUI application

---

## Standards & Research

**Agile Methodology:**
- Fibonacci estimation techniques presented to multiple SEAME teams
- Practical planning exercise conducted using planningpokeronline

**Development Tools:**
- GitHub Actions cross-compilation pipeline established
- QEMU emulator investigation for embedded testing automation
