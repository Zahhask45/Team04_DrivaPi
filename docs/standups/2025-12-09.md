# Day 43 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** Monday, December 9, 2025

**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

---

## What We Did Today

The team focused on Sprint 5 planning and technical implementations. Research for unit tests was initiated and CAN debugging for latency testing continued. Rust code implementation for remote control inputs via CAN to STM32 was developed.
