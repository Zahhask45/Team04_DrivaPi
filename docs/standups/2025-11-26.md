# Day 36 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** Tuesday, November 26, 2025

**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

## What We Did Today

The team achieved significant integration progress. Melanie successfully refactored and tested the Qt application with vCAN simulation, confirming CAN data processing and speed display functionality, then elaborated TSF planning diagrams for team review. Miguel achieved simultaneous servo and motor operation with successful testing. Bernardo continued speed calculation integration into ThreadX. Gaspar debugged SSD boot issues (uboot USB detection) and discovered SerialBus library missing from AGL build. Hugo worked on GitHub Actions STM32 emulation, implementing stub code with debug outputs to bypass hard fault errors.

## Challenges

**Problem:** SSD Boot - Uboot USB Detection
- **Who:** Gaspar
- **Impact:** High
- **Solution:** Discovered uboot does not detect USB; issue is in USB connection configuration from Raspberry Pi side. Will need to configure USB properly.

**Problem:** AGL Missing SerialBus Library
- **Who:** Gaspar
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Qt app compiles successfully with cross-compilation but fails to execute on AGL due to missing SerialBus library. Will rebuild AGL with required library included.

**Problem:** GitHub Actions STM32 Emulation Hard Fault
- **Who:** Hugo
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** STM32 emulation proving difficult with hard fault errors. Hugo implementing STUB solution - rewriting code to replace functions with debug outputs for testing purposes in CI/CD pipeline.

## Decisions

**Qt Application Status:**
- **Decision:** Qt app refactoring complete and tested with vCAN simulation
- **Outcome:** CAN data processing and speed display confirmed working
- **Next Steps:** Deploy to actual hardware environment

**TSF Planning Approach:**
- **Decision:** TSF planning and hierarchy diagram completed
- **Next Steps:** Team discussion scheduled for tomorrow to review and validate diagram and requirements structure

**Motor Integration:**
- **Decision:** Simultaneous servo and motor operation achieved
- **Next Steps:** Integrate code into main ThreadX architecture

---

## Standards & Research

**TSF Framework Development:**
- Planning and hierarchy diagram elaborated
- Initial requirements structure defined
- Team review scheduled for tomorrow

**CI/CD Improvements:**
- STUB code approach being developed for STM32 testing
- Alternative to full hardware emulation
- Debug outputs replacing function calls for automated testing
