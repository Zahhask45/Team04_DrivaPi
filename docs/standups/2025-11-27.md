# Day 37 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** Wednesday, November 27, 2025

**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

## What We Did Today

The team made significant progress on architecture planning and system integration. Melanie presented the updated TSF architecture diagram with team feedback incorporated and continued work on cross-compilation testing for CAN communication with Qt. Miguel implemented movement code on ThreadX platform and debugged I2C errors. Hugo resolved GitHub stub implementation issues for automated testing and successfully integrated ultrasonic sensor with buzzer for obstacle detection. Gaspar fixed AGL errors, implemented Wayland with EGL troubleshooting, and assisted with CAN setup. Bernardo completed speed sensor code on ThreadX and tested CAN messaging with the Qt application.
