## Team Progress

### Bernardo - Hardware Integration & Testing
- ✅ Switched power-up sequence to test phase version
- ✅ Soldered cables for GPIO
- 🔄 Writing script to verify the speed sensor

### Gaspar - OS & Development Environment
- ✅ Formatted and successfully booted AGL using the cross sdk image
- 🔄 Facing issues with the SDK extended dependencies

### Hugo - Hardware & Fabrication
- ✅ Conducted successful showcase of STM32 and IDE
- ✅ Successfully connected the CAN bus to the microcontroller

### Melanie - GUI & Team Coordination
- 🔄 Investigated nomenclature for TSF artifacts
- 🔄 Found blockers: score inheritance from parent to child (should not happen) and results not displaying correctly

### Miguel - GitHub Project & Agile/Scrum
- ✅ Presented showcase of GenAI automation workflow
- ✅ Collected feedback from team for document improvements
- ✅ Updated workflow document submitted to GitHub
