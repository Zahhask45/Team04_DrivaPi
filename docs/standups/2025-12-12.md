# Day 46 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** Friday, December 12, 2025

**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

## What We Did Today

The team focused on tooling decisions and hardware integration. Testing frameworks were researched, test coverage and static analysis tools were selected, and the new display hardware was set up. The AGL image was migrated to Weston, CAN documentation was written, and Kuksa integration work continued with performance testing.

## Team Progress

### Bernardo - Hardware Integration & Testing
- ✅ Researched testing frameworks
- ✅ Set up the new display hardware
- 🔄 Display issue identified (needs debugging/follow-up)

### Gaspar - OS & Development Environment
- ✅ Changed the Operating System Image of the cross SDK to Weston
- 🔄 Display issue identified (needs debugging/follow-up)

### Hugo - Hardware & Fabrication
- ✅ Studied hardware functionality and how the device flashes to the memory map
- 🔄 Writing CAN documentation

### Melanie - GUI & Team Coordination
- ✅ Made simple configurations in the Kuksa feeder
- ✅ Tested latency and converted code from Python to C++
- 🔄 Identified that Kuksa does not have time to process all sent messages (bottleneck issue)

### Miguel - GitHub Project & Agile/Scrum
- ✅ Conducted spike on test coverage, Unity testing, and static analysis
- ✅ Decided on the tools to be utilized
- ✅ Prepared Markdown document for presentation to the team
