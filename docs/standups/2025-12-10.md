# Day 44 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** Tuesday, December 10, 2025

**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

## What We Did Today

Kuksa Yocto build environment successfully configured for Raspberry Pi 5, CAN bitrate optimization tested, comprehensive latency documentation completed, and unit testing framework research initiated.

---

## Team Progress

### Bernardo - Hardware Integration & Testing
- ✅ Researched unit testing frameworks for STM32/ThreadX
- ✅ Collaborative analysis with Miguel on testing strategy

### Gaspar - OS & Development Environment
- ✅ Worked with Hugo increasing CAN bitrate (500 kbps → 1000 kbps)
- ✅ Testing performance improvements and signal integrity

### Hugo - Hardware & Fabrication
- ✅ Completed CAN latency study with statistical analysis
- ✅ Documented three test configurations (1000 samples each)
- ✅ Collaborated with Gaspar on bitrate optimization

### Melanie - GUI & Team Coordination
- ✅ Configured Yocto build on seame-4 for Kuksa architecture
- ✅ Compiled grpc, protobuf, abseil-cpp for aarch64 (Raspberry Pi 5)
- ✅ Started KuksaReader class implementation in Qt app
- 🔄 Kuksa-Qt integration in progress

### Miguel - GitHub Project & Agile/Scrum
- ✅ Researched unit testing frameworks for STM32/ThreadX
- ✅ Collaborative analysis with Bernardo on testing strategy

## Software

**Progress:**
- ✅ Kuksa databroker ready for Raspberry Pi 5 deployment
- ✅ CAN latency: 789 µs (round-trip), 248 µs (STM32 internal), 593 µs (RPi loopback)
- ✅ Bitrate optimization testing (500 → 1000 kbps)
- ✅ Unit test framework evaluation completed

---

## Decisions

**CAN Bitrate Upgrade:**
- **Decision:** Testing 1000 kbps (currently 500 kbps)
- **Rationale:** ~128 µs latency reduction per round-trip
- **Next steps:** Validate with real hardware

**Kuksa Integration:**
- **Decision:** Proceed with databroker on Raspberry Pi 5
- **Next steps:** Complete Qt integration, measure latency vs direct CAN

---

## Standards & Research

**CAN Latency Results:**
- STM32: 248 µs median (2 µs std dev - excellent determinism)
- Round-trip: 789 µs median (suitable for 10-100 Hz control)
- Linux overhead: ~345 µs vs bare-metal
