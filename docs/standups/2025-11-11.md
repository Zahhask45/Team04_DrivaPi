## Hardware

**Speed Sensor Development:**

Bernardo is implementing the speed sensor interface with focus on reading and speed calculations. Miguel is identifying appropriate timer peripherals and configuring capture mode for rising/falling edge detection.

**Conversion Formula:**
```
Speed = (f_signal × Wheel Circumference) / Gear Ratio
```
