# Day 53 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** Tuesday, January 6, 2026

**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

---

## What We Did Today

The team focused on code quality improvements and repository organization. Major activities included comprehensive STM32 code refactoring with Doxygen documentation headers, repository structure normalization, speed sensor requirements definition, unit test automation enhancements, and GitHub repository protection configurations.

## Team Progress

### Bernardo - Hardware Integration & Testing
- ✅ Added Doxygen headers to some STM32 code for automatic documentation generation
- ✅ Performed code refactoring across STM32 codebase
- ✅ Fixed code indentation throughout STM32 files

### Gaspar - OS & Development Environment
- ✅ Refactored GitHub repository structure
- ✅ Normalized file and folder naming conventions
- ✅ Reorganized repository files and folders for better structure

### Hugo - Hardware & Fabrication
- ✅ Configured branch protection rules on master branch to prevent force pushes
- 🔄 Started STM32 Flow diagram using mermaid

### Melanie - GUI & Team Coordination
- ✅ Created requirements for speed sensor based on implemented tests
- 🔄 Studying Python script adaptation for parsing CodeQL static analysis SARIF results

### Miguel - GitHub Project & Agile/Scrum
- ✅ Implemented changes requested by reviewers on the PR related to unit tests and GitHub Actions automation
- ✅ Increased branch coverage percentage to approximately 97%
- ✅ Fixed issue where speed sensor tests passed but HTML coverage report wasn't opening
