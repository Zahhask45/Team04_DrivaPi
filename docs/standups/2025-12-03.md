# Day 39 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** Tuesday, December 3, 2025

**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

## What We Did Today

The team focused on documentation, research spikes, hardware planning, and ThreadX integration. Gaspar prepared the sprint retrospective presentation for Friday. Hugo completed and got approval for CAN documentation, then began theoretical spikes on USB Dongle and latency analysis. Bernardo reviewed CAN connections and drafted a manual sketch for pin mapping on STM32. Miguel changed code to use I2C3, integrated servo and motor control code into ThreadX, and prepared for integration with Gaspar's Rust remote control code. Melanie conducted Kuksa and VSS spike with latency testing to evaluate its viability as a middleware layer between CAN communication, Qt app, and cloud services.

## Challenges

**Problem:** CAN Address Coordination for Integration
- **Who:** Miguel
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Miguel needs to coordinate with team to obtain CAN addresses for servo motor, DC motor, and speed sensor before integration with Gaspar's Rust remote control code can proceed

**Problem:** Kuksa Viability Assessment
- **Who:** Melanie
- **Impact:** High
- **Solution:** Conducting comprehensive latency tests to determine if Kuksa introduces acceptable overhead as middleware layer. Testing three-way integration: CAN ↔ Kuksa ↔ Qt app and Kuksa ↔ Cloud

## Decisions

**CAN Documentation:**
- **Status:** Completed and approved
- **Outcome:** Team has comprehensive reference for CAN implementation
- **Next Steps:** Documentation available for all team members

**USB Dongle Spike Approach:**
- **Decision:** Focus on theoretical research only, skip practical implementation
- **Rationale:** Prioritize understanding concepts before potential implementation
- **Next Steps:** Hugo to document findings, team will decide on practical phase later

**STM32 Pin Configuration:**
- **Decision:** Reaching final pin assignments for production use
- **Impact:** Critical for hardware stability and preventing future conflicts
- **Next Steps:** Create formal structured diagram from Bernardo's manual sketch

## Standards & Research

**Kuksa/VSS Investigation:**
- Evaluating Eclipse Kuksa as middleware solution
- Assessing Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) integration
- Key questions being addressed:
  - What is latency overhead of Kuksa layer?
  - Can Kuksa handle real-time CAN data effectively?
  - Is Kuksa suitable for cloud integration?
  - Does Kuksa add value vs. direct CAN-to-Qt communication?

**USB Dongle Spike:**
- Theoretical research on USB Dongle implementation for vehicle systems
- Investigating use cases and technical requirements
- No practical implementation at this stage

**Latency Spike (Planned):**
- Hugo will investigate system latency across communication layers
- Critical for real-time vehicle control systems
- Will inform architecture decisions

**ThreadX Integration:**
- Miguel actively integrating servo and motor control into ThreadX RTOS
- Refactoring hard-coded sections for better testability
- Preparing for integration with remote control functionality
