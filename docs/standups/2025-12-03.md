# Day 40 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** Tuesday, December 3, 2025

**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

## What We Did Today

The team focused on documentation, research spikes, and system integration. Hugo completed CAN documentation (approved) and started USB Dongle theoretical spike and latency investigation planning. Bernardo reviewed CAN pin connections and drafted manual STM32 pin mapping sketch. Miguel migrated to I2C3 and is integrating servo/motor control into ThreadX, preparing for remote control integration. Melanie is conducting Kuksa/VSS spike with latency testing. Gaspar worked on sprint retrospective presentation for Friday.

## Hardware

**STM32 Pin Mapping:**
- Bernardo completed manual sketch of all pin connections in STM32
- Reaching finalization phase for pin assignments
- Critical for preventing future pin conflicts and rewiring
- Formal diagram will be created from manual sketch

## Software

**Progress:**
- ✅ CAN documentation completed and approved (Hugo)
- 🔄 Sprint retrospective preparation underway (Gaspar)
- 🔄 I2C3 implementation completed (Miguel)
- 🔄 Servo and motor control integrated into ThreadX (Miguel)
- 🔄 Kuksa/VSS spike initiated with latency testing (Melanie)
- 🔄 USB Dongle theoretical spike started (Hugo)

## Challenges

**Problem:** CAN Address Coordination Needed
- **Who:** Miguel
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Coordinate with team to define CAN addresses for servo motor, DC motor, and speed sensor before proceeding with remote control integration

**Problem:** Kuksa Latency Overhead Unknown
- **Who:** Melanie
- **Impact:** High
- **Solution:** Conducting latency tests to determine if Kuksa middleware introduces acceptable overhead. Testing: CAN ↔ Kuksa ↔ Qt app and Kuksa ↔ Cloud connections

## Decisions

**CAN Documentation:**
- **Status:** Completed and approved
- **Outcome:** Team has comprehensive reference for CAN implementation
- **Next Steps:** Documentation available for all team members

**USB Dongle Spike Approach:**
- **Decision:** Focus on theoretical research only, skip practical implementation
- **Rationale:** Prioritize understanding concepts before potential implementation
- **Next Steps:** Hugo to document findings, team will decide on practical phase later

**STM32 Pin Configuration:**
- **Decision:** Reaching final pin assignments for production use
- **Impact:** Critical for hardware stability and preventing future conflicts
- **Next Steps:** Create formal structured diagram from Bernardo's manual sketch

## Standards & Research

**Kuksa/VSS Investigation:**
- Evaluating Eclipse Kuksa as middleware solution
- Assessing Vehicle Signal Specification (VSS) integration
- Key questions being addressed:
  - What is latency overhead of Kuksa layer?
  - Can Kuksa handle real-time CAN data effectively?
  - Is Kuksa suitable for cloud integration?
  - Does Kuksa add value vs. direct CAN-to-Qt communication?

**USB Dongle Spike:**
- Theoretical research on USB Dongle implementation for vehicle systems
- Investigating use cases and technical requirements
- No practical implementation at this stage

**Latency Spike (Planned):**
- Hugo will investigate system latency across communication layers
- Critical for real-time vehicle control systems
- Will inform architecture decisions

**ThreadX Integration:**
- Miguel actively integrating servo and motor control into ThreadX RTOS
- Refactoring hard-coded sections for better testability
- Preparing for integration with remote control functionality
