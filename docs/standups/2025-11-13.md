## Hardware

**STM32 Speed Sensor Integration:**
- Successfully reading input from speed sensor
- Script development for wheel rotation to speed conversion in progress
- Combining sensor readings with calculation algorithms

---

## Software

**Progress:**
- ✅ Python code review completed
- ✅ Structure defined for 7 main requirements
- ✅ GitHub repository made public
- 🔄 STM32 documentation ongoing
- 🔄 ThreadX presentation for STM32 in final stages
- 🔄 Validator documentation for Trudag in progress

---

## Challenges

**Problem:** SSD Configuration Issues
- **Who:** Gaspar
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Re-building kernel with Yocto Project

---

## Decisions

**GitHub Repository Governance:**
- Option A: Keep current review process
- Option B: Increase oversight with public visibility and mandatory reviews
- **Decision:** Made repository public and require 2 reviewers on each PR for better code quality, transparency and security

---

## Standards & Research

- ThreadX RTOS documentation and presentation for STM32 implementation
- Trudag validator documentation framework established
