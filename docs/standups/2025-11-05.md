## What We Did Today

Today the team focused on TSF training and presentation, Sprint 3 planning refinement, STM32 speed sensor development, retrospective preparation, and continued work on AGL development. Melanie delivered a comprehensive TSF presentation covering ISO 26262, ASIL calculation, and SME evaluation methodology. Miguel finalized sprint planning and prepared for individual team member meetings. Bernardo developed speed sensor conversion scripts while facing IDE challenges. Hugo prepared the sprint retrospective presentation. Despite ongoing cross-compilation challenges, Gaspar achieved a significant milestone by successfully building AGL on SSD and completing the flash.

  - ASIL definition and calculation methodology
  - Evidence linking in requirements
  - SME evaluation process and score attribution
- ✅ Prepared hands-on lab for tomorrow (Lab 2: Complete SWD-998 and Safety Documentation)

### Miguel - GitHub Project & Agile/Scrum
- ✅ Completed Sprint 3 planning for next week
- 🔄 Preparing for individual meetings with each team member tomorrow to:
  - Adjust sprint planning
  - Optimize user stories and tasks
  - Address individual concerns

## Hardware

**Speed Sensor Development:**

Bernardo developed a C script to convert speed sensor signals from the STM32. The script processes:
- Input: Pulses from speed sensor
- Parameters: Wheel diameter, revolutions
- Output: Speed in m/s

Discussion on implementation location (STM32 vs Raspberry Pi 5) concluded that STM32 would be a good approach according to facilitators, though both options are viable.

## Software

**Progress:**
- ✅ AGL successfully built on SSD and flashed (major milestone!)
- ✅ TSF training materials presented
- ✅ Lab 2 preparation completed for tomorrow's session
- ✅ Sprint 3 planning finalized
- ✅ Speed conversion algorithm implemented in C
- 🔄 Cross-compilation environment development ongoing
- 🔄 Retrospective presentation in progress

## Challenges

**Problem:** STM32 IDE Installation
- **Who:** Bernardo
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** After multiple installation difficulties, decided to work directly with code without IDE. Successfully developed speed sensor conversion script despite tooling issues.

**Problem:** Speed Conversion Implementation Location
- **Who:** Bernardo
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Team discussed whether conversion should happen on STM32 or Raspberry Pi 5. Facilitators recommended STM32 approach, though both are technically viable. Decision pending based on CAN communication complexity and compatibility with Qt app.

**Problem:** AGL Cross-Compilation with Extensible SDK
- **Who:** Gaspar
- **Impact:** High
- **Solution:** Another challenging day dealing with cross-compilation issues. However, achieved significant progress by successfully building AGL on SSD and completing the flash. Explained specific cross-compilation problems during stand-up meeting. Facilitators acknowledged these are difficult and very specific issues that they couldn't directly help with. Team recommendation: compile Qt directly in AGL, identify necessary libraries, and import them into cross-compilation environment. This workaround is being explored but team is trying to avoid this bypass approach for now.

**Problem:** CAN Communication Compatibility
- **Who:** Bernardo
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Concerns about sending speed data via CAN from STM32 and ensuring compatibility with Qt app for accurate display. Team needs to define CAN message format and verify end-to-end data flow.

## Decisions

**Speed Conversion Location:**
- Option A: Perform conversion on STM32 microcontroller
- Option B: Send raw pulses to Raspberry Pi 5 and convert there
- **Decision:** Facilitators recommended STM32 approach as best practice. Team will proceed with this approach while maintaining compatibility with CAN communication.

**Cross-Compilation Strategy:**
- Option A: Continue debugging extensible SDK issues
- Option B: Compile Qt directly in AGL and import libraries (bypass)
- **Decision:** Team prefers to solve root cause (Option A) but will explore Option B as temporary workaround if needed. The bypass approach is being avoided for now to maintain proper development workflow and avoid technical debt. Success with AGL build and flash provides solid foundation for next steps.
