## What We Did Today

The team completed major milestones including finishing the KUKSA spike, submitting Qt code for review. Sprint Retrospective was presented, pending PRs were reviewed, and STM32-to-Raspberry Pi communication latency testing code was created. ThreadX test code implementation and template refactoring were finalized, with GitHub Actions guidance provided to support CI/CD setup.
