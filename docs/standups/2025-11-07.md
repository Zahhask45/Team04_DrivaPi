## What We Did Today

Today was focused on preparing and executing the Sprint Retrospective. Gaspar successfully installed AGL on the SSD and got it running at 100%, while also completing dependency installations on the Micro SD for testing purposes. Melanie worked on incorporating validators into a local extension and attempted packaging as a plugin for Trudag. The team prepared the Sprint Retrospective presentation, with Bernardo creating the logo and reviewing the presentation, Hugo presenting the Retrospective, and Miguel planning Sprint 3.
