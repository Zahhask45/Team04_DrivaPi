## What We Did Today

Today was focused on preparing and executing the Sprint Retro. Gaspar successfully installed AGL on the SSD and got it running at 100%, while also completing dependency installations on the Micro SD for testing purposes. Melanie worked on incorporating validators into a local extension and attempted packaging as a plugin for Trudag. The team prepared the Sprint Retro presentation, with Bernardo creating the logo and reviewing the presentation, Hugo presenting the retro, and Miguel planning Sprint 3, which starts on Monday, November 10, 2025.
