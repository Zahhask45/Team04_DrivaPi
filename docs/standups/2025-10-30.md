# Day [17] - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** Thursday, October 30, 2025

**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

## What We Did Today

Today Melanie investigated about Automative SPICE and ISO 26262 and also created guidelines for HARA and ASIL (to validate the evidences and levels of ASIL). We talked to the learning facilitators to clarify some doubts about the Microcontroller-to-Raspberry communication and also uProtocol (it has been implemented in TCP/IP, Rust, but no CAN-BUS). Gaspar fixed dependencies for Cross-compilation and switched to agl-image-minimal-crosssdk. Miguel modified the "Issues" and "PR" templates to implement GenAI; he also picked and justified the use of Copilot. Hugo investigated how certain signals are processed in the STM32 Microcontroller and is getting familiarized with their IDE. Bernardo disassembled the car to complete the connections between every current component and fixed the wheel sensor issues.

## Team Progress

### Bernardo - Hardware Integration & Testing
- ✅ Connected various components using CAN-BUS so Hugo could conduct research and learn how the STM32 handled the messages.
- ✅ Disassembled and reassembled the car to make connections between components.
- ✅ Troubleshooted the car wheel mount and added another screw.

### Gaspar - OS & Development Environment
- 🔄 Working on QT dependencies to enable cross-compiling for QT.
- ✅ Fixed cross-compilation dependencies.
- ✅ Switched from agl-image-minimal to agl-image-minimal-crosssdk.

### Hugo - Hardware & Fabrication
- ✅ Troubleshooted the car wheel
- 🔄 Continued exploring ThreadX and STM32 microcontroller programming, with code working directly on the microcontroller but facing issues in ThreadX execution.
- 🔄 Investigating how the system handles CAN-BUS messages now that everything is connected.

### Melanie - GUI & Team Coordination
- 🔄 Investigating Automative SPICE and ISO 26262.
- ✅ Created guidelines for HARA and ASIL
- ✅ Document on artifacts conventions approved and available.

### Miguel - GitHub Project & Agile/Scrum
- ✅ Implemented GenAI with Copilot, fully documented and justified.
- 🔄 Making a workflow automation draft.
- 🔄 Preparing a presentation for the team about workflow automation.

## Software

**Progress:**
- 🔄 Progressing on QT integration and cross-compiling.
- 🔄 Troubleshooting ThreadX code execution on STM32.
- ✅ Updated TSF workflows, templates, and documentation.

---

## Challenges

**Problem:** Difficulties executing code in ThreadX (works directly on microcontroller).
- **Who:** Hugo
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Continue studying ThreadX documentation and seek additional team support if needed.

## Decisions

**GenAI Tool Selection:**
- Option A: TabNine Pro – Better anticipation, customizable, and trainable, but with associated costs.
- Option B: Copilot Pro – Integrated in VSCode, uses newer models, and available for free as 42 students.
- **Decision:** Copilot Pro (confirmed after team presentation). It's now fully implemented.

## Standards & Research

- Bernardo's research on communication methods: Ethernet preferred for uProtocol due to stability and high data flow handling; CAN and CAN_FD comparisons completed, with challenges noted for uProtocol on CAN. Documentation in progress.
