# Day 49 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** Tuesday, December 17, 2025

**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

## What We Did Today

CodeQL static analysis workflow was successfully deployed, identifying security issues in the codebase. Testing infrastructure advanced with unit test framework integration in stm32 and development of unit tests for motor and speed sensor code. Dependabot was updated for automated dependency management, cross-compilation for Rust was studied, and Kuksa latency testing was completed on Linux.

## Team Progress

### Bernardo - Hardware Integration & Testing
- ✅ Developed unit tests for speed sensor code using ceiling framework
- 🔄 Created five test cases: out of bounds, abnormal conditions, and limits
- 🔄 Working on "normal" test cases

### Gaspar - OS & Development Environment
- ✅ Updated Dependabot configuration for weekly dependency checks
- ✅ Dependabot successfully created pull requests for version updates
- ✅ Studied cross-compilation for Rust
- ✅ Configured Raspberry Pi Zero as DNF server for Raspberry Pi 5
- 🔄 Cargo workflow for Dependabot remains commented (Rust not yet in use)

### Hugo - Hardware & Fabrication
- ✅ Deployed GitHub Action for CodeQL static analysis
- ✅ Pull request approved and CodeQL workflow is operational
- 🔄 Identified High and Medium security warnings in code
- 🔄 Investigating security warnings from ThreadX-generated code
- 🔄 Planning to configure GitHub Action to focus on team-written code only

### Melanie - GUI & Team Coordination
- ✅ Completed Kuksa latency testing on Linux environment
- ✅ Discovered CAN provider configuration allows defining frame processing time
- ✅ Validated Kuksa implementation as middleware
- ✅ Measured average latencies: CAN 0.148ms, Kuksa 2.212ms
- 🔄 Next: Implement latency tests with real hardware

### Miguel - GitHub Project & Agile/Scrum
- ✅ Completed spike and documentation on unit test framework decision
- ✅ Started integration of unit test framework in STM32
- 🔄 Developing unit tests for motor and servo code

## Challenges

**Problem:** Security Warnings from ThreadX-Generated Code
- **Who:** Hugo
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Planning to configure CodeQL to analyze only team-written code, excluding ThreadX-generated files

**Problem:** High and Medium Security Issues Identified
- **Who:** Team
- **Impact:** High
- **Solution:** Security warnings need to be addressed; prioritizing team-written code issues first

---

## Decisions

**CodeQL Static Analysis:**
- **Decision:** CodeQL workflow deployed; will be refined to exclude ThreadX-generated code and focus on team contributions

**Kuksa as Middleware:**
- **Decision:** Latency tests validate Kuksa implementation (2.212ms average latency acceptable for middleware layer)

---

## Standards & Research

**Static Analysis:**
- CodeQL deployed for automated security analysis
- Security warnings categorized by severity (High, Medium)

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- Unit test framework integrated for STM32
- Ceiling framework used for speed sensor tests
- Test cases include: out of bounds, abnormal conditions, limits, and normal scenarios

**Latency Testing:**
- CAN average latency: 0.148ms
- Kuksa average latency: 2.212ms
- Configuration allows defining frame processing time in CAN provider
