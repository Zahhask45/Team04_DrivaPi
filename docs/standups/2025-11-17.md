# Day 29 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** November 17, 2025

**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

---

## What We Did Today

The team conducted a collaborative brainstorming session to define the architecture for power consumption monitoring. Hugo assisted Miguel with structuring ThreadX implementation and contributed to the power consumption architecture design. Melanie addressed workflow issues with GitHub Actions for the TSF scoring system. Bernardo debugged output issues with his STM32 code implementation, while Miguel focused on testing and debugging the Rust-to-C code conversion. Gaspar made progress on the AGL build process for the SSD despite encountering build-related challenges.
