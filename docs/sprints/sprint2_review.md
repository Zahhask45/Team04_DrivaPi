# Sprint 2 Review - Team04 DrivaPi

**Date:** November 10, 2025
**Project:** DrivaPi - Autonomous Vehicle Platform

---

## Sprint Summary

Sprint 2 was marked by **steady progress**, **team maturity**, and **balanced objectives**.
The team successfully consolidated the foundations established in Sprint 1, integrating feedback from facilitators while refining planning and organization.

A new reflective exercise was introduced:
Each member summarized the sprint in **three words** and explained their reasoning — providing insight into both team and individual perspectives.

- **Goals** – Adjusted our planning and objectives to match what’s realistically expected.

### **Gaspar**
- **Fantastic** – We achieved all the planned objectives.
- **Tedious** – AGL setup can be long and repetitive, especially when fixing logs and bugs.
- **Quick** – The sprint felt short; time passed fast due to the team’s workflow.

### **Bernardo**
- **Complete** – Many breakthroughs, but also meaningful challenges.
- **Structured** – Strong daily planning and methodology.
- **Scattered** – Found it difficult to focus, completing many small tasks but lacking a sense of large concrete deliverables.

### **Miguel**
- **Well** – Everything went smoothly and without major blockers.

### **Melanie**
- **Pride** – Proud of both individual and collective achievements as team coordinator.
- **Middle-term** – Learned to balance ambition with realistic, sustainable goals.
- **Discovery** – Started learning Python to implement `trudag` validators, opening new technical paths.

## Key Highlights

- Improved **internal organization** and communication flow.
- Integration of feedback from Sprint 1 regarding **real-time terminology**, **cross-compilation**, and **microcontroller strategy**.
- Continued development of **technical documentation** and **modular approach**.
- First experiments and research in **Python-based validation tools (trudag)**.

---

## Areas to Improve

- Define **more measurable sprint goals** and success criteria.
- Maintain focus on **core priorities** to avoid dispersion.
- Continue refining **task estimation and planning accuracy**.

---

## Overall Team Sentiment

The general tone of the sprint was **positive and confident**.
Team04 DrivaPi showed increased **cohesion, organization, and autonomy**, with members recognizing both technical and personal growth since Sprint 1.

## Next Steps - Sprint 3 Focus

1. Advance **STM32 integration** and **CAN Bus communication**.
2. Finalize **Qt on AGL** implementation and ensure UI stability.
3. Establish **cross-compilation toolchain** and document process.
4. Define **clear, measurable objectives** for the sprint.
5. Continue Python-based **validator development**.
