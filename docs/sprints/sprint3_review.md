# Sprint 3 Review - Team04 DrivaPi

**Date:** November 24, 2025
**Project:** DrivaPi - Autonomous Vehicle Platform

---

## Sprint Summary

Sprint 3 was **extremely positive**, with the vast majority of tasks completed successfully. The team demonstrated **high productivity** and **strong execution**, achieving all proposed objectives for the sprint. The few remaining tasks are currently under review and will be carried forward.

---

## Key Achievements

### Technical Progress

**High Completion Rate** - Almost all planned tasks were finalized
**Goals Achieved** - The team met all sprint objectives
**System Integration** - Continued advancement in hardware and software integration
**Documentation Quality** - Maintained high standards in technical documentation

---

## Technical Challenges and Considerations

### Latency Concerns
**Challenge:**
Latency issues might happen when utilizing wireless controller.

**Consideration:**
The team must account for these latency constraints in system design and real-time performance requirements. It was proposed an intensive study on that topic.

---

## Individual Team Feedback

### **Gaspar**
**Reflection:** Would have liked to successfully boot AGL (Automotive Grade Linux) directly from the SSD instead of microSD card.

**Context:** This would improve system performance and reduce boot times, aligning with production-grade deployment strategies.

### **Miguel**
**Reflection:** Would have liked to connect the motors and servo to STM32IDE earlier in the Sprint cycle.

**Context:** Earlier integration would have allowed more time for testing and refinement of the microcontroller communication layer.

## Areas for Improvement - Sprint 4 Focus

To optimize workflow and precision in the next cycle, the team will focus on:

### 1. **Improve PR Specifications**
- Enhance guidelines and level of detail in Pull Requests (PR)
- Improve code review quality and consistency

### 2. **Automate Processes**
- Implement and use GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Automate build processes and testing pipelines
- Reduce manual intervention in deployment workflows

### 3. **User Story Estimates**
- Adopt the Fibonacci sequence for story point estimation
- Improve accuracy in effort estimation
- Better alignment between planned and actual completion times

## Overall Team Sentiment

The team demonstrated **strong cohesion**, **high productivity**, and **technical maturity** throughout Sprint 3. The achievement of all sprint goals reflects the team's growing expertise and effective collaboration.

---

## Next Steps - Sprint 4 Priorities

1. **Boot AGL from SSD** for improved performance
2. **Complete RTOS integration on STM32IDE** and finalize communication layer
3. **Implement GitHub Actions** for automated CI/CD
4. **Adopt Fibonacci estimation** for user stories

---

## Conclusion

Sprint 3 solidified Team04 DrivaPi's trajectory toward a robust, production-ready autonomous vehicle platform. The team's ability to identify and address technical challenges proactively, combined with strong execution, positions the project well for the final development phases.

**The team continues to deliver exceptional results!**
