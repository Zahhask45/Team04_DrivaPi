**Guidance**

Expectations must be explicitly documented and validated:

- Operational Design Domain (ODD) with clear boundaries
- Performance expectations for AI perception and planning
- Environmental and operational constraints
- Safety requirement traceability to expectations

The system should detect when operating outside documented expectations and transition to appropriate safety states. Expectations should be validated through testing and analysis.
