**Guidance**

Construction processes must be defined, validated, and consistently followed:

- CI/CD pipeline with safety validation gates
- Coding standards and static analysis enforcement
- Automated testing with coverage requirements
- Build reproducibility and environment control
- Tool qualification for safety-critical toolchains

Processes should be documented and auditable, with clear criteria for acceptance and rejection of artifacts.
