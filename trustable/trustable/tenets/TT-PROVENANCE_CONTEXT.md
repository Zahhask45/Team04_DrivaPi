**Guidance**

Provenance ensures traceability and auditability:

- Requirement-to-code traceability matrices
- Evidence chain for each safety claim
- Change impact analysis capabilities
- Audit trail for all safety decisions
- Version control for all safety artifacts

Provenance should be automated where possible and regularly verified for completeness. It should support both forward and backward traceability.
