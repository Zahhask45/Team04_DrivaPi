**Guidance**

Verifiable and repeatable results are essential for safety certification:

- Automated test reproducibility
- Deterministic build processes
- Runtime behavior consistency
- Evidence reproducibility
- Independent verification capability

Results should be documented with sufficient detail to allow independent reproduction. Test environments and conditions should be controlled and documented.
