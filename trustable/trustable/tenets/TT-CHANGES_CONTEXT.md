**Guidance**

We expect that the DrivaPi system will undergo changes throughout its lifecycle, including updates to AI models, control algorithms, and safety mechanisms. Changes must be managed to maintain trust in safety claims.

This requires:

- Verification that updated components still satisfy safety expectations
- Understanding of update frequency and responsiveness for safety fixes
- Analysis of changes to assess impact on system safety
- Ability to modify third-party components when suppliers cannot meet safety needs

The change management process must consider the system's operational context and ensure that modifications do not introduce new hazards or violate safety assumptions.
