**Guidance**

Safety-critical autonomous systems must demonstrate confidence through objective measures. For DrivaPi, this includes:

- AI perception confidence scores with calibration
- Control system timing guarantees with evidence
- Communication reliability metrics
- Safety state transition probabilities

Confidence measures should be continuously monitored and used to inform system behavior, such as transitioning to degraded modes when confidence drops below thresholds.
