## What We Did Today

We made significant progress across both hardware and software aspects. The 3D model for the speed sensor was finalised, the display (cluster) is now working, and a basic GUI was developed using Qt (cu-te).

Additionally, progress was made on the AGL build and GitHub project organisation. We also held our first planning meeting, receiving positive feedback on our weekly progress.
