# Day 1 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Project:** PiRacer Autonomous Vehicle Platform
**Team:** Team04

## What We Did Today

Today was our first day working on the PiRacer project. We focused on hardware assessment, initial assembly, and planning our software architecture approach.

### Hardware Inventory and Setup
Started by unpacking and cataloging all the PiRacer components to understand what we're working with:

Began the mechanical assembly process, connecting the main board to the chassis:

### Technical Challenges

#### Speed Sensor Mounting Issue
The main problem we ran into was with the speed sensor mounting. The standard mount doesn't align properly with our setup, so we'll need to design and 3D print a custom mounting bracket. This is pretty critical since we need accurate speed measurement for the autonomous driving features.

#### Software Architecture Decisions
We spent a good chunk of time researching our technology stack options:

**Programming Language Choice:**
- **C++**: More mature toolchain, excellent Qt integration, industry standard in automotive
- **Rust**: Better memory safety, growing adoption in automotive, more future-oriented
- **Decision**: We'll prototype in both to compare them properly

**Real-Time Operating System:**
- **ThreadX (Azure RTOS)**: ISO 26262 certified for automotive safety, which is important
- **FreeRTOS**: Community-driven, lots of documentation, easier to get started
- **Plan**: Test both with LED control on STM32 to see which works better for our needs

**GUI Framework:**
- Qt looks like our best bet for the user interface - good cross-platform support and integrates well with our hardware

### Development Environment Planning
We need to set up several different environments:
- Raspberry Pi OS as our base system (might migrate to Automotive Grade Linux later)
- Qt Creator for GUI development
- Development tools for both ThreadX and FreeRTOS
- GitHub workflow for team collaboration (still waiting on access credentials)

### Assembly Progress
Made solid progress on the physical build:

Successfully mounted the camera module and completed most of the wiring:

</p>

### Eclipse SDV Integration Research
We also looked into how this fits with the broader Eclipse Software Defined Vehicle (SDV) framework:
- Service-oriented architecture approach
- AUTOSAR compliance considerations
- Vehicle-to-cloud connectivity using MQTT
- Container orchestration for scalable deployment

This is important because we want this to be more than just a one-off project - the goal is to build something that could scale to real automotive applications.

## Tomorrow's Plan (October 9)

**Morning (9:00-12:00):**
- Finish mechanical assembly
- CAD design for the speed sensor mount
- Test power distribution system

**Afternoon (14:00-17:00):**
- Set up Raspberry Pi OS
- Install Qt Creator and test basic "Hello World"
- Configure development environments for ThreadX and FreeRTOS
- Start basic programming tests

## Current Status and Challenges

**What's Working:**
- Hardware assembly is about 25% complete and on track
- Team collaboration is going really well
- We have a clear understanding of our technical requirements

**Challenges:**
- Speed sensor mounting needs custom solution (3D printing dependency)
- Multiple technology options to evaluate - don't want to get stuck in analysis paralysis
- GitHub team access still pending
- Lots of different development environments to set up

**Technical Decisions Pending:**
- Final programming language choice (C++ vs Rust)
- RTOS selection (ThreadX vs FreeRTOS)
- Timeline for migrating from Raspberry Pi OS to Automotive Grade Linux

## Standards and Compliance
We're keeping in mind several industry standards as we develop:
- ISO 26262 functional safety requirements
- AUTOSAR framework integration
- COVESA vehicle signal specifications
- Eclipse Foundation open-source methodologies

The goal is to build something that's not just a cool prototype, but actually follows automotive industry best practices.

Overall, a productive first day! We have a clear picture of what we need to do and a solid plan for moving forward.
