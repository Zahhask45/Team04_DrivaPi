# Day 10 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** November 03, 2025  
**Team:** Hugo, Gaspar, Bernardo, Miguel, Melanie

## What We Did Today

Today we ran the daily test activities and held a Gen AI workshop. Hardware work included a fabrication problem that needs repair, while cross-compilation progressed for software builds.

---

## Team Progress

### Bernardo - Hardware Integration & Testing
- 🔄 Messed up the table and removed the glue — cleanup and re-bonding required
- ✅ Follow-up repair or reassembly to be scheduled

### Gaspar - OS & Development Environment
- ✅ Cross-compiling toolchain set up and running — thank you, Gaspar!
- 🔄 Continue validating cross-compiled builds across targets

### Hugo - Hardware & Fabrication
- 🔄 Supporting hardware cleanup and verification after table incident
- ✅ Coordinating with Bernardo on repair steps

### Melanie - GUI & Team Coordination
- 🔄 Supporting team containment and coordination while lead is away
- ✅ Communicated status to the group and tracked actions

### Miguel - GitHub Project & Agile/Scrum
- ✅ Delivered a Gen AI workshop (beautifully done)
- 🔄 Assist team members applying learnings to current tasks

---

## Hardware

**What was done:**
- Table was accidentally altered (glue removed) and requires re-bonding and inspection for alignment and strength. Bernardo will lead the repair.
- Hugo and Melanie will support reassembly and QA.

## Software

**Progress:**
- ✅ Cross-compilation progressed (Gaspar)
- 🔄 Further integration testing of cross-compiled artifacts is ongoing

---

## Challenges

**Problem:** Table/glue removal during hardware work  
- **Who:** Bernardo  
- **Impact:** Medium — affects immediate test setup and may delay verification steps  
- **Solution:** Reapply appropriate adhesive, inspect for structural integrity, retest the setup. Hugo to assist; target repair today.

**Problem:** Big boss still sick, affecting team containment and decision flow  
- **Who:** Project lead / big boss  
- **Impact:** High — central coordination and approvals slowed  
- **Solution:** Interim coordination by Melanie; escalate critical approvals to backup leads and continue with non-blocking tasks.

---

## Decisions

**Workshop application:**  
- Option A: Immediately apply Gen AI techniques to current sprint tasks (pilot on non-critical items)  
- Option B: Schedule a short follow-up session for hands-on implementation next week  
- **Decision:** Pilot application on non-critical items this sprint; Miguel to coordinate.

---

## Standards & Research

- Continue validating cross-compiled binaries against current CI targets.
- Document hardware repair steps (adhesive type, curing time, alignment checks) for future reference.
