## What We Did Today

We finished fitting the wheel speed sensor in the custom designed part.
Edited most of our documentation to the SEAME-pt GitHub .
Continued the AGL setup, it's functional but now has a problem with Wi-Fi.
Attempted QT implementation but had problems with the internal network and/or given company laptops.
