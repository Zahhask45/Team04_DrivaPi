# Day 5 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** October 14, 2025

**Team:** Hugo, Gaspar, Bernardo, Miguel, Melanie

## What We Did Today

We tested the fitting with the improvements on the holder of the speed sensor and noticed a misalignment of the hole.
For the first time, we were able to power the entire car through the expansion board.🥳🥳
We also migrated all of our documentation to the SEAME-pt GitHub .
Continued the AGL setup and made significant progress.
Improved the Qt features and started building its deployment.
