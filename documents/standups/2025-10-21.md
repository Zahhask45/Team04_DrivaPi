# Day [10] - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

## What We Did Today

Today, we continued the study and implementation of TSF. We also worked on automating pull requests.

In terms of software, we wrote Rust code for the servo motor, DC motor and joystick.

For the first time, we had the car running on battery power. Additionally, we successfully ran our Qt application on the Raspberry Pi.

## Team Progress

### Bernardo - Hardware Integration & Testing

- 🔄 Likely switching from CAN FD to standard CAN, as the microcontroller supports it but lacks the necessary inputs. We’ll confirm in tomorrow’s meeting.

- ✅ Repeatedly disassembled the car for testing and debugging.

</p>

- ✅ Power issues encountered — only the Raspberry Pi and SSH were working. The root cause was identified as a faulty cable.

- ✅ Used the car with the remote control for the first time.

- ✅ Worked on resolving steering issues related to the servo motor.

- ✅ Installed CAN bus transceiver instead of the CAN FD transceiver.

### Gaspar - OS & Development Environment & software Development 

- ✅ Got the car running using Rust.
- 🔄 No progress on AGL because we don’t have a second Raspberry Pi.

### Hugo - Qt app Development

- ✅ More attempts to cross-compile, but faced issues due to library dependencies.
- ✅ Tried static compilation to include libraries within the binary, but this also didn’t work as expected.
- ✅ Final approach, compile the binary directly on the Raspberry Pi, which was successful and fast.
- ✅ Set up the Qt application to run on the Raspberry Pi.
- 🔄 Gain a better understanding of how to use the CAN bus to communicate between the Raspberry Pi and the microcontroller.

### Melanie - GUI & Team Coordination

- ✅Stopped using Doorstop as it’s no longer compatible with current versions of Truth Drag.

- ✅Switched to using only Truth Drag and redefined the requirements to manage the TSF.

- ✅Tested the setup with the GitHub Actions workflow — results were positive.

- 🔄 Waiting for Eclipse training to gain more clarity on the TSF content.

- 🔄 Due to limited documentation, it’s unlikely TSF will be completed within this sprint.

- 🔄 Began preparing the presentation for the end-of-sprint retrospective.

- ✅ Successfully drove the car for the first time — a valuable hands-on experience.

### Miguel - GitHub Project & Agile/Scrum
- ✅ Created templates for pull requests and issues.
- 🔄 [In progress]
