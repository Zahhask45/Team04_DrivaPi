# Day 6 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** October 15, 2025

**Team:** Hugo, Gaspar, Bernardo, Miguel, Melanie

## What We Did Today
 - Gaspar got AGL running! He had initially followed a 2020 tutorial but ran into issues with Bluetooth, graphics, and several outdated files. He restarted following a 2022 tutorial; we set a goal to have AGL working by the end of this week, and if it failed we would switch to Android Automotive. In the meantime AGL is running, although Wi‑Fi isn't working yet (missing binaries and other small issues still to fix).
 - Bernardo created a hardware diagram and already connected and tested the camera — it is working.
 - We noticed a low-voltage warning because many components are powered through the expansion board; we need to propose a solution for the power distribution.
 - Hugo studied Qt app deployment and cross-compilation. The plan is to make the Qt app interactive and then flash it via SSH. The part is ready and the speed sensor is nearly finished; Hugo already sent the file to Maria for printing.
 - Miguel and Melanie spent the day understanding the TSF → SDV flow. Melanie reviewed Doorstop and Trudag; Miguel focused on TSF principles (tenets, assertions, statement construction). The plan is to automate the TSF → SDV steps via GitHub Actions — initial mappings are in progress.
 - We are preparing a short internal presentation to share progress and align next steps; the team continues to share ideas and knowledge.
 - We held a stand-up meeting with facilitators and the project coordinator to surface questions and blockers; Miguel presented our doubts and received feedback and guidance.

## Team Progress

### Bernardo - Hardware Integration & Testing
- 🔄 Find solutions for the PiRacer power supply.
- 🔄 Organize and secure all cables for optimal layout and safety.
- ✅ Create hardware diagram and connect the camera — camera is functional.

### Gaspar - OS & Development Environment
- ✅ Get AGL running (started over following a 2022 tutorial). Bluetooth and graphics issues addressed; Wi‑Fi missing some binaries and needs follow-up.

### Hugo - Hardware & Fabrication
- 🔄 Speed sensor part nearly ready; Hugo sent the print file to Maria.
- 🔄 Finalize Qt deployment approach: studied cross-compilation, interactive Qt, and flashing via SSH.

### Melanie - GUI & Team Coordination
- 🔄 Reviewed Doorstop and Trudag for TSF implementation; preparing materials for an internal presentation and ongoing knowledge sharing.

### Miguel - GitHub Project & Agile/Scrum
- 🔄 Work on TSF → SDV mapping: focused on TSF principles (tenets, assertions, statement construction) and planning GitHub Actions automation for TSF → SDV.

## Hardware

**Progress:**

- Eureka! We got AGL running after switching to a 2022 tutorial. Next step is to fix Wi‑Fi (missing binaries).

## Software

**Progress:**

- AGL: system is running after switching to a 2022 tutorial, but Wi‑Fi is not yet working due to missing binaries — follow-up required.
- Qt deployment: we are exploring cross-compilation and flashing via SSH; the app will be made interactive before deployment.
- TSF → SDV: continuing investigation (Doorstop, Trudag) and planning GitHub Actions workflows for integration.

## Challenges

**Problem:** AGL Wi‑Fi not available yet (missing binaries).
- **Who:** Gaspar
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Solution:** Identify and install missing firmware/binaries; if needed, fallback to Android Automotive by end of week.

**Problem:** Low-voltage warnings when powering via the expansion board.
- **Who:** Bernardo, Hugo
- **Impact:** High (risk to stability)
- **Solution:** Propose and test a power distribution plan (separate power rail or regulator), measure currents, and update wiring to avoid undervoltage.

## Decisions
**AGL deployment strategy:**
- Option A: Continue with AGL, fix Bluetooth/graphics/Wi‑Fi and missing binaries, and finalize GUI deployment.
- Option B: Switch to Android Automotive to reduce setup time and use an alternative stack.
- **Decision:** Option A — continue with AGL for now. Goal: have AGL fully functional (including Wi‑Fi) by end of week; if critical Wi‑Fi/binary issues remain unresolved by then, switch to Android Automotive as a fallback.

## Standards & Research

- Investigate TSF
- Investigate Cross-compilation for Qt apps
