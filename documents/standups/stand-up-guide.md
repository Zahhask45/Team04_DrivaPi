## 🚫 Blocker Tracking

### How to Identify Blockers

**A blocker is something that:**
- Completely stops progress on a task
- Affects multiple people
- Requires external help
- Has been stuck for >1 day

**Not a blocker:**
- "I'm still working on it" (that's just in progress)
- "It's difficult" (that's normal)
- Questions that can be answered in 2 minutes

### Blocker Template

```markdown
### Blocker: [Brief Title]
- **Owner:** [Who's blocked]
- **Impact:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- **Days Open:** [X]
- **Status:** [Open/In Progress/Resolved]
- **Next Action:** [What needs to happen]
- **Help Needed:** [Who/what could unblock this]
```

### Blocker Board

Track in GitHub Project under "Blockers" column:
- 🔴 Critical (stops all work)
- 🟠 High (stops significant work)
- 🟡 Medium (slows progress)
- 🟢 Low (minor inconvenience)
