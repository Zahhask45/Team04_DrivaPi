## What We Did Today

Today was focused heavily on team training, process improvement, and cross-compilation refinement. Key achievements include:
<br>
- TSF Implementation & Training: Initial TSF (Trustable Software Framework) implementation and documentation began. A training session was prepared and finalized for the team, to be presented on Tuesday.
- Workflow Automation: Implemented Git Actions to improve and automate our development workflows.
- Documentation & Project Setup: Significant progress was made on the GitHub documentation, particularly refining the Project view and Scrum board setup.
- Hardware Research: Completed a study on the micro-controller to better inform future hardware and software integration decisions.
- Cross-Compilation Effort: Continued working intensely on cross-compilation issues, essential for deploying the Qt application to the target hardware.
