# Day [11] - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Date:** October 22, 2025
**Team:** Bernardo, Gaspar, Hugo, Melanie, Miguel

## What We Did Today

Today, the team focused on critical software and hardware integration tasks. Key progress was made on the Qt application, which is now successfully running on the Raspberry Pi 5 after shifting the compilation strategy. On the hardware front, we conducted an in-depth study of the CAN Bus communication protocol and identified a potential compatibility issue that requires a change in our approach.

Development on the AGL continues, though we've encountered some compatibility conflicts. We also finalized GitHub documentation and prepared materials for an upcoming internal training session.

## Team Progress

### Bernardo - Hardware Integration & CAN Bus Research

- ✅ Studied the CAN Bus hardware connections, discovering that the cables must be twisted to prevent signal interference.
- ✅ Connected to the slave CAN Bus module to understand the device's communication flow with other hardware components.
- 🔄 Found that CAN Bus FD is not compatible with the current slave module. Researched alternatives and will present the issue and potential solutions at the next stand-up meeting.

### Gaspar - OS & Development Environment

- 🔄 Continued development on the AGL (Automotive Grade Linux).
- ❌ Encountered compatibility errors and conflicts between u-boot, the Yocto Project, and AAGL.

### Hugo - Qt App Development & Sensor Testing

- ✅ Successfully displayed and ran the Qt application on the Raspberry Pi 5.
- ✅ Resolved compilation issues by building directly on the Raspberry Pi, which proved to be a fast and effective alternative to cross-compiling.
- ✅ Wrote a C++ program to read high/low signals from a sensor, confirming it is functioning correctly.
- ✅ Finalized yesterday's daily log (including adding a gif) and worked on the Qt documentation.
- 🔄 Began studying how the microcontroller works to prepare for future integration.

### Melanie - Training & Team Coordination

- ✅ Decided to proceed with an internal training session to proactively address team questions.
- ✅ Created the presentation and a hands-on lab for the training.

### Miguel - GitHub Project & Agile/Scrum
- ✅ Completed the documentation for the GitHub repository.
- ✅ Collaborated with Melanie to create a Kahoot quiz for tomorrow's training session.
