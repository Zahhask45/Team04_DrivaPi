# Sprint 1 - SEAME Automotive Journey

**Dates:** October 13-24, 2025

### Bernardo - Hardware Integration & Testing

✅ Successfully connected and tested the display (cluster instrument) on the Raspberry Pi.

✅ Assemble the Pi Racer with the new custom parts.

✅ Find solutions for the PiRacer power supply.

✅ Organize and secure all cables for optimal layout and safety.

✅ Soldered a 6-pin connector to the expansion board to provide direct power to the screen.

✅ Fully power all components through the expansion board using batteries.

✅ Create hardware diagram and connect the camera — camera is functional.

✅ Assemble the Pi Racer with the new custom parts.

✅ Organize and secure all cables for optimal layout and safety, including the new custom-made cable with the required length.

🔄 Find solutions for the PiRacer power supply, which is was still having problems after last fix.

✅ Solved problems related to 42's Work Experience module while on SEA:ME.

🔄 Find solutions for the PiRacer power supply.

✅ Conducted research and study on the micro-controller.

✅ Found and fixed problem with speed sensor with short-circuit.

✅ Conducted research and study on the micro-controller.

🔄 Planned the switching from CAN FD to standard CAN, as the microcontroller supports it but lacks the necessary inputs.

✅ Repeatedly disassembled the car for testing and debugging.

✅ Power issues fixed — only the Raspberry Pi and SSH were working. The root cause was identified as a faulty cable.

✅ Used the car with the remote control for the first time.

✅ Worked on resolving steering issues related to the servo motor.

✅ Installed CAN-BUS transceiver instead of the CAN FD transceiver.

✅ Connected the CAN-BUS to the STM32 microcontroller, and the Master CAN-BUS to the Raspberry Pi 5.
