  text: |
    The system SHALL read vehicle speed data from the CAN bus at 10Hz.

    This requirement defines how the system obtains speed data for display.

  # --- Added for completeness (based on template) ---
  rationale: |
    The CAN bus is the standard source for vehicle dynamics data.
    A 10Hz polling rate (every 100ms) matches the parent URD's
    latency requirement.

  acceptance:
    - GIVEN: The system is powered on and connected to the CAN bus
      WHEN: A valid speed message (e.g., CAN ID 0x123) is broadcast
      THEN: The system SHALL read and buffer the raw speed data within 100ms
