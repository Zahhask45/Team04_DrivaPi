  header: "Convert CAN speed data for display"
  text: |
    The software SHALL convert raw CAN speed data (0.1 km/h units) to
    integer km/h and update the display module within 50ms of receipt.

  # --- Added for completeness (based on template) ---
  rationale: |
    The raw CAN signal uses a scaling factor (0.1) for precision, which
    must be converted to a simple integer for the display. The 50ms
    budget provides sufficient time for processing within the 100ms
    system-level deadline.

  acceptance:
    - GIVEN: The software receives raw CAN data '200' (representing 20.0 km/h)
      WHEN: The conversion function is called
      THEN: The display module's update function SHALL be called with the integer value '20'
    - GIVEN: The conversion function is called
      WHEN: The function is executing
      THEN: It SHALL complete within its 50ms time budget
