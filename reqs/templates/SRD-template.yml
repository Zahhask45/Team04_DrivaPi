    The system SHALL [specific system behavior].

    This requirement describes HOW the system provides the capability
    described in the parent user requirement. Include technical details
    about system-level behavior, interfaces, and performance.

    Be specific about:
    - What the system does
    - When it does it
    - Performance requirements (timing, accuracy)
    - Error handling
