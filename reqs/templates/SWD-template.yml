    The software SHALL [specific software behavior/implementation].

    This requirement describes HOW the software implements the parent
    system requirement. Include specific implementation details:

    - Algorithms and data structures
    - Software interfaces and APIs
    - Timing and performance constraints
    - Error handling and recovery
    - Resource management (memory, CPU)

    Example:
    "The software SHALL read sensor data via I2C interface at address 0x48
    with 12-bit resolution, sampling at 10Hz, and SHALL timeout after 100ms
    if no response is received."

  # Acceptance criteria (required for testability)
  acceptance:
    - GIVEN: software module initialized
      WHEN: function X is called with parameter Y
      THEN: SHALL return Z within 10ms

    - GIVEN: invalid input parameter
      WHEN: function X is called
      THEN: SHALL return error code -1 and log warning

  # Rationale
  rationale: |
    Why this specific software implementation approach was chosen.
    Trade-offs considered (performance vs complexity, etc.)

  # Assumptions
  assumptions:
    - Compiler version and optimization level
    - Available memory and CPU resources
    - Third-party library versions
    - Hardware abstraction layer APIs
