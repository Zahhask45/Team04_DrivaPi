    Test case to verify [SWD requirement ID].

    This test case SHALL verify that the software requirement is correctly
    implemented by executing specific test procedures and validating results.

    Test Procedure:
    1. Setup: Initialize test environment
    2. Preconditions: Set initial state
    3. Test steps: Execute test actions
    4. Validation: Check expected results
    5. Cleanup: Restore system state

    Pass Criteria:
    - All assertions pass
    - Performance within specified limits
    - No unexpected errors or warnings

  # ASIL Level: Must match parent SWD requirement
  ASIL: B

  # Verification Method: Unit Test / Integration Test / System Test
  Verification Method: Unit Test

  # Links to parent SWD requirement(s) being tested
  links:
    - SWD-001

  # Test details
  test_type: Unit Test  # Unit / Integration / System / Acceptance

  # Test procedure (detailed steps)
  test_procedure:
    setup:
      - Initialize test harness
      - Mock dependencies
      - Set initial conditions

    preconditions:
      - Module under test is compiled
      - Test data files available
      - Mock objects configured

    test_steps:
      - step: 1
        action: Call function with valid input
        expected: Function returns expected value

      - step: 2
        action: Call function with boundary value
        expected: Function handles correctly

      - step: 3
        action: Call function with invalid input
        expected: Function returns error code

    postconditions:
      - No memory leaks
      - All resources released
      - System state restored

  # Acceptance criteria (what makes test pass)
  acceptance:
    - GIVEN: test environment initialized
      WHEN: test procedure executed
      THEN: all assertions SHALL pass

    - GIVEN: valid test inputs
      WHEN: function under test called
      THEN: SHALL return expected outputs within timing constraints

  # Test coverage
  coverage:
    - Nominal case (happy path)
    - Boundary conditions
    - Error conditions
    - Performance requirements
