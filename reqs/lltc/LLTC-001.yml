    Test case to verify [SWD requirement ID].

    This test case SHALL verify that the software requirement is correctly
    implemented by executing specific test procedures and validating results.

    Test Procedure:
    1. Setup: Initialize test environment
    2. Preconditions: Set initial state
    3. Test steps: Execute test actions
    4. Validation: Check expected results
    5. Cleanup: Restore system state

    Pass Criteria:
    - All assertions pass
    - Performance within specified limits
    - No unexpected errors or warnings
