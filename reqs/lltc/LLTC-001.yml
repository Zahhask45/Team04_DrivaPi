  test_procedure:
    setup:
      - Initialize speed_converter module
    preconditions:
      - Mock display module is injected
    test_steps:
      - step: 1
        action: Call speed_converter.update(200)
        expected: Mock display_module.set_speed() called with value 20
      - step: 2
        action: Call speed_converter.update(0)
        expected: Mock display_module.set_speed() called with value 0
      - step: 3
        action: Call speed_converter.update(201)
        expected: Mock display_module.set_speed() called with value 20 (truncation)
    postconditions:
      - No errors thrown

  acceptance:
    - GIVEN: Test procedure is executed
      WHEN: All test steps complete
      THEN: All assertions SHALL pass
