# DrivaPi Artifacts

Auto-generated artifacts from requirements management and traceability processes.

## 📦 Directory Structure

### 📚 Baselines (`baselines/`)
Timestamped archives of approved requirements at specific points in time.

**Format:** `DrivaPi-requirements-BASELINE-{CATEGORY}-{VERSION}-{TIMESTAMP}.tar.gz`

**Example:** `DrivaPi-requirements-BASELINE-SWD-V1.0-20251015T141446Z.tar.gz`

**Usage:**
- Provides snapshot for auditing
- Enables rollback if needed
- Required for ISO 26262 compliance

### 🔗 Traceability (`traceability/`)
Auto-generated traceability matrices and gap reports.

**Files:**
- `manifest.json` - Metadata about generation (timestamp, file count, etc.)
- `matrix.csv` - Consolidated traceability matrix (all links)
- `matrix-forward.csv` - Requirements → Implementation (forward trace)
- `matrix-backward.csv` - Implementation → Requirements (backward trace)
- `matrix-urd.csv` - User requirements traceability
- `matrix-srd.csv` - System requirements traceability
- `matrix-swd.csv` - Software requirements traceability
- `matrix-lltc.csv` - Test case traceability
- `gap-report.csv` - Identifies missing links and orphaned requirements
- `report.md` - Human-readable summary report

**Generated by:**
```bash
python scripts/traceability/traceability_check.py
```

**Regenerated:** On every commit via CI/CD

### 📊 Reports (`reports/`)
Analysis reports and compliance assessments.

**Files:**
- `tsf-compliance.md` - TSF compliance status report
- `confidence-assessment.json` - Confidence scores per requirement
- `missing-fields.csv` - Requirements with incomplete fields
- `remediation.md` - Recommendations for improvements

**Generated by:**
```bash
python scripts/analysis/tsf_confidence_assessment.py
python scripts/analysis/generate_missing_fields_csv.py
```

## 🔄 Artifact Lifecycle

1. **Requirements created/updated** → Committed to `reqs/`
2. **CI runs validation** → Linter checks, Doorstop validation
3. **Traceability generated** → Matrices created in `artifacts/traceability/`
4. **Reports updated** → Analysis reports in `artifacts/reports/`
5. **Baseline created** (on approval) → Archive in `artifacts/baselines/`

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Do NOT commit artifacts to git** (except baselines)
  - Add to `.gitignore`: `artifacts/traceability/*`, `artifacts/reports/*`
  - Keep baselines in git for audit trail

- **Artifacts are ephemeral** - Regenerated on each CI run
- **Baselines are permanent** - Timestamped snapshots
